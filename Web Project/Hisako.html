                Hisako steps backwards into the ground, then appears behind her opponent. Invulnerable to high attacks. After reappearing Hisako can cancel the recovery with a normal or special.

                Hisako raises her naginata in front of her, attempting to counter an opponent's attack. Three punches is her high counter and only catches high and mid attacks. Three kicks is her low counter which only catches low attacks.

              <td>
                Hisako swings her naginata in front of her in a three stage rekka attack. Button strength of the first swing determines the speed and range. The second and third button presses determine whether the swing will be an overhead, low or mid. Shadow On Ryo Zan is projectile invincible, has longer range and can recapture. All Rekka swings are unsafe on block.

             <td>
                Hisako swings her naginata in a 180 degree arc in front of her while in the air causing her to fall to the ground immediately. Button strength determines startup time and distance traveled. Air On Ryo Zan can recapture if Hisako has full wrath otherwise it causes a hard knockdown. Heavy Air On Ryo Zan can crossup. Shadow Air On Ryo Zan will always recapture. All Air On Ryo Zans are safe on block.

            <th><strong>Influence</strong></th>
             <td>
                Hisako grabs her opponent and hits them in the face with the butt of her naginata then places it into the ground behind her and teleports behind her opponent and pushes them into the blade of the naginata.
                Button strength determines startup frames and distance traveled. Light influence is the fastest grab in the game and is invincible to other throw attempts. Influence causes a hard knockdown but if Hisako has full wrath meter then it acts as an opener to a combo. Shadow Influence causes Hisako to crawl on the ground to greatly extend the range of the throw and the opponent cannot jump out of it unless they were already jumping before the super flash. Always causes a hard knockdown.

             <td>
                Hisako opens her mouth and pulls her opponent in with a ghostly vacuuming aura before entering their body and contorting their bodies breaking their bones. Button strength determines the range and speed of the vacuum effect. Possession always causes a knockdown on hit. Shadow Possession greatly extends the range and speed of the vacuum effect.

    <p id="width">Hisako's Theme</p>
    
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Strengths</h1>
    <p id="width">Hisako's best strength is her ability to make her opponent scared to do anything. She has the fastest and longest range dash in the game that also goes under projectiles, she has the fastest command grab in the game that can lead into a combo, she has a parry that can counter an opponents attack and it leads into a combo and her counter hits cause more hitstun to her opponent making hit confirming a breeze with her.Her normals have massive range making her neutral game great because she has the ability to control so much space. She has a great anti air that can lead to a recapture. One of Hisakos greatest strength is that she has the ability to keep her opponent exactly at any range she wants them to be at.</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Weaknesses</h1>
    <p id="width">While Hisako has one of the best dashes in the game, she also has the worst walk speed in the game. Hisako's walkspeed has abysmal speed and is even slower than the biggest character in the game which means when she does decide to move she has to heavily commit which sometimes can lead to unfavorable results. While all her normals are great and have very long range, they come with a downside. All her grounded normals are negative on block and all have long start ups meaning that when you do decide to press buttons with her its a commitment and you have to be careful when you press the buttons because if pressed at the wrong time can lead to a counter hit on her. Hisako is also one of the few characters that cannot combo from her light attacks without meter.</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Unique Mechanic</h1>
    <p id="width">Hisako's unique mechanic is her wrath meter. Above her shadow meter she has a green bar, that is her wrath meter. Everytime Hisako uses a heavy or medium attack her wrath meter deplete and regenerates when she isn't doing anything. When Hisako's wrath meter is full her next attack will always cause a counter hit. The wrath meter is broken up into two points and Hisako can use 1 point of meter during almost any of her normals and specials to instantly cancel whatever she is doing into a parry. Having wrath meter is what makes Hisako so scary so be sure to always keep it charged up as best as you can.</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center2">Instinct</h1>
    <p id="width">Hisako's instinct gives her infinite wrath meter for a set period of timne. During instinct Hisako becomes very scary because previously all her normals and specials were unsafe on block but with full wrath meter she has the ability to cancel any of them into a parry which means even if she were to mess up and whiff an attack she has the option to cancel into a parry if the opponent decides to try and punish her.</p>

    <h1 id="underline" class="center2">Gameplan</h1>
    <p id="width">Hisako shines best at midrange where her amazing normals control the space. Ideally as Hisako you would want to control the mid range and look for any opening you can knock your opponent down. Once your opponent is knocked down you are able to put them into a vortex where they can't be sure if you're going to perform a cross up, command grab, a meaty or an overhead. Against very fast characters however Hisako's gameplan to keep them away from her as best she can with her normals. Try and keep your wrath up at all times so when you do make a mistake you always have the option to cancel into a parry but don't do this too much however because it will make you predictable.</p>
