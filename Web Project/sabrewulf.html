    <p id="width">Sabrewulf's Theme</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Strength</h1>
    <p id="width">Sabrewulf has the scariest rushdown in the game. He is extremely mobile, extremely hard to react to and can hit from high or low in a split second. He is able to dash through opponents to get to the other side which gives him amazing reset potential. His normals are very good for a rushdown character and he has one of the best instincts in the game.</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Weakness</h1>
    <p id="width">Sabrewulf has a very short jump which can make it difficult to jump in on characters who control the horizontal space very well. This means that against these characters sabrewulf must fully commit to an action to try and get in on his opponent. Without shadow meter, when Sabrewulf is knocked down he has no reversal options so he is forced to take his opponents mix ups.</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Unique Mechanic</h1>
    <p id="width">Sabrewulf is able to dash through his opponent crossing to the other side which no other character can do. During his combos as well he is able to repeatedly use the same strength linkers which will progessively increase in speed as well.</p>
    <h1 id="underline" class="center">Instinct</h1>
    <p id="width">Sabrewulfs instinct upon activation allows him access to feral cancels and his normals now cause chip damge meaning that even if the opponent blocks his attacks they still take partial damage. Feral cancels allows Sabrewulf to cancel any move whether it be on hit, on block or even if he whiffs it. The reason this is so scary is because normally Sabrewulfs moves are all unsafe on block well feral cancels make everything safe for him and it also opens up a world of mix up options for him because he is able to cancel everything right away. An example would be if he was attacking from the front he would feral cancel his attack and immediately dash through the opponent and begin attacking from the other side.</p>

    <h1 id="underline" class="center2">Gameplan</h1>
    <p id="width">Sabrewulf wants to be right next to his opponent at all times, his normals are extremely fast and his mix up potential is near infinite. Sabrewulf has all the tools he needs to get in on his opponent but they do come with a drawback, they're all unsafe on block so when getting in on his opponent Sabrewulf must heavily commit to what he does. Sabrewulf however unlike other rushdown characters is also blessed with very good normals as well which means if Sabrewulf is unable to get in on his opponent he also has the ability to play the mid range as well and poke at them. If Sabrewulf gets close to his opponent, he is pretty much free to run the show until the opponent manages to get away from him.</p>
