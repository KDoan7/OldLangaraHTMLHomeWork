        <h3>Fighting Game Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Anti Air</b> - An attack done from the ground serving the purpose of attacking an opponent who is in the air. Moves of this kind generally enjoy high priority or are upper-body invincible.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Armor</b> - Normally, when a character executing a move gets hit, the move gets interrupted. The concept of Armor refers to the quality of a move by which a character executing the move can sustain a number of such hits before the move gets interrupted. Typically, the Armor is limited to one hit. If a character gets hit twice, while executing a move with one hit Armor, the move stops.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Auto Correct</b> - An auto correct happens when you input a move when your back is to the opponent (usually a special move) and the computer automatically turns (corrects) your player and subsequently the move towards the opponent.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Baiting</b> - Baiting consists of doing certain moves and movements to try and elicit a certain reaction or move from an opponent, and then punishing that reaction or move.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Block</b> - When a character is blocking, he/she is in a defensive state that protects him/her from being damaged by his/her opponent's moves (or, in certain cases, softens the damage). Blocking is often performed by tilting the joystick away from the player's opponent, otherwise a specific button is used to block. Usually there is more than one kind of block (most often "high" and "low"), each of which protects against and is vulnerable to different classes of moves. In most games, blocking can be countered by a throw.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Block Stun</b> - is the delay before a player can perform another move after successfully blocking a move</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Bread and Butter (BnB)</b> - Refers to a "bread and butter" combo or technique for a character. Usually this is one combo or technique whose use is ubiquitous and highly recommended due to its efficacy, ease of execution, and versatility. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cancels</b> - Canceling is defined as breaking out of a current animation or move by inputting another move that will cancel the previous one.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Command Move</b> - Is move that is performed by a simple combination of the joystick and button. Example is forward + punch.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Command Grab</b> - A command grab (or command throw) differs from normal throws. Normal throws can be 'teched' which means that you can escape from being grabbed by pressing various button sequences. Command throws are untechable and are more damaging than normal throws. The only drawback to this is the fact that most of them require some complex directional inputs to be performed.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Conditioning</b> - The act of making the opponent get used to a certain course of action by means of repeated exposure to the same situation. For example, you can condition the opponent to block low on wakeup if you always attack low after a takedown. This can then be useful if you want to take advantage of some strategy that requires starting with an overhead.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Counter Hit</b> - A counter hit is a term for an attack that hits another player while they are in the process of performing an attack. In many fighting games this type of attack is granted bonus damage. and/or additional effects</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cross Up</b> - A cross-up is a situation where it is more difficult for your opponent to determine whether they must block left or right. Most commonly, this is done by attacking while jumping over your opponent so that it hits as one passes over them.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Dash</b> - A dash is a movement which is both faster than normal movement and requires some sort of input more complex than simply holding one direction on the joystick. Dashes are executed in most fighting games by double-tapping the direction</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Dragon Punch (DP)</b> - Used to describe a a move that is similar to Ryu and Ken from the Street Fighter series Shoryuken. Generally DPs are uppercuts that are invincible on startup and usually come with a high risk high reward factor.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Footsies</b> - “Footsies” is oldschool slang for the mid-range ground-based aspect of fighting game strategy. It refers to a situation where both players are outside of combo range and attack each other with long-range, generally safe attacks (pokes). The ultimate goal is to control the flow of the match, bait the opponent into committing errors, and punish everything.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Frame Advantage</b> - A move which allows the player to recover before his opponent leaves either hit stun on hit or block stun on block is considered to have frame advantage in those areas. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Hit Confirm</b> - The act of waiting to see if an attack lands, to then continue into a combo or special attack. Hit confirm may also refer to using a safe attack to see if you are able to land a combo or not.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Hit Stun</b> - This refers to the amount of time of frames it takes you to recover after being hit by a certain attack.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Invincibility</b> - Certain moves have invincible frames during the attack where they cannot be hit</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Juggle</b> - A combo where the victim is hit multiple times in the air</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Link</b> - Linking moves is the act of performing a move with quick startup immediately after a move with quick recovery has connected while your opponent is still in hit stun, thus linking both attacks together into a combo.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Low Attack</b> - An attack that must be blocked while crouching</li>

    <h1>The Basics</h1>
    <p id="width">The first thing you should do is to pick a character that appeals to you. Once you have a character selected you want to get a look at each of their normals and see what they look like then you look at their movelist and get familiar with everything that character can do and how to do it.</p>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Health</h2>
    <p id="width">Fighting games are generally played one verse one and involve both players picking a character of their choice and attacking eachother until one players healthbar is reduced to 0. Killer Instinct is no different, Killer Instinct has two characters facing off against eachother and the goal is to reduce the opponents healthbar to 0 by attacking them. Unlike other fighting games however that implement the round system where if a players health is reduced to 0 then the round ends and both players health bars are reset to full and the characters are again placed in their starting positions in the middle of the stage and the first to win two rounds wins the game, Killer Instinct uses the health bar system where every character comes with two health bars. After the first health bar has depleted the character lays on the ground for a few seconds then their second health bar comes up while their opponent keeps whatever remaining health they have in their health bar. It is important to note too that your position between rounds do not reset so it is important to reposition yourself while the opponent is laying on the ground. Killer Instincts healthbar is unique to other fighting games. If your healthbar is green then you're on your first healthbar, if its red then you're on your second. Killer Instinct has something called white life which is potential health you can lose if your opponent ends his combo which we will learn about later. White life is life that can regen if you haven't been hit for a few seconds. White life is accumulated when you're being comboed by your opponent and if the opponent uses an ender in their combo then you will lose your white life but if they don't, when you're out of the combo and not being attacked your white life will regenerate. When you're on your second healthbar and your health is reduced to 15% then you enter a danger state where if you start to be comboed by your opponent then they have the option of ending the match with an ultra combo which we will also discuss further down.</p>

        <figcaption>Standard healthbar</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Movement</h2>
    <p id="width">Movement in Killer Instinct is the same as other traditional 2D fighting games. The character can either walk forward or backwards in a 2d space or jump forward or backwards. Each character has different walk speeds and different dash speeds, so be sure to experiment with different characters! Every character can jump to cover more ground faster and to get on top of your opponent, but be careful because you cannot block while you're jumping and become susceptible to anti airs. Some characters have different jump properties so again be sure to experiment with your characters!</p>

        <figcaption>Notice the different jumps these two can do</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Blocking</h2>
    <p id="width">Blocking in this game is performed by holding the opposite direction of your opponent. For example if your opponent is attacking you from the right side then you would hold left. Some attacks are overheads and can only be blocked by standing and other attacks are known as lows which can only be blocked while crouching. Jump attacks can only be blocked while standing. There are also some attacks that are unblockable so be sure to watch for those and jump out of the way before its too late! Your opponent will be throwing out all kinds of different attacks which will make it harder for you to block so be sure to practice your defence!</p>

    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Normals &amp; Specials</h2>
    <p id="width">Killer Instinct has 6 buttons. A light punch, medium punch, heavy punch, light kick, medium kick and heavy kick. These are referred to as normals becaus they are performed by simply pressing a button on your controller. Each normal has different start up speeds and each of them have different ranges so be sure to play around with them. Command normals are done by holding a direction and inputting a button press. Specials are moves that require a motion along with a button press. For example to throw a fireball you would input a quarter circle forward with your analog stick along with any punch button. Special moves properties are controlled by what strength button you used to execute them. For example if you were to throw a fireball with light punch then the fireball will be slow but if you were to throw a fireball with a heavy punch then the fireball will be fast. Almost every special also has a shadow variant of it that you can use if you choose to spend your shadow meter. Shadow specials are the same as your regular specials but they gain additional properties. Every character has their own unique set of special moves so be sure to get yourself familiar with your characters specials!</p>

        <figcaption>Note the normal special didn't go through the fireball but the shadow version did.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Throws</h2>
    <p id="width">Throws are performed by pressing both the light punch and light kick buttons at the same time when near the opponent. Throws cannot be blocked but can be broken out of by also inputting a throw of your own at the same time as the opponent. All throws cause a hard knockdown meaning the opponent cannot get up for a set amount of time. There are also things called command throws. Command throws cannot be blocked or broken out of, the only way to get out of a command throw is to jump away or to not be near the character inputting the command throw. Some characters have unique throws such as being able to throw while in the air.</p>

    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Armor</h2>
    <p id="width">Some characters have moves that have armor on them, meaning they can absorb one hit and still go through rather than being stopped when hit. The counter to attacks that have armor is to throw.</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Wall Splats</h2>
    <p id="width">Some moves at the end of a combo can wall splat your opponent. Wall splats are when you push your opponent against the wall at the end of the combo and they bounce off of it giving you a chance to attack them again for extra damage.</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Recaptures</h2>
    <p id="width">Recaptures are moves that put the opponent back into a standing state after they've been knocked into the air allowing you to continue comboing them.</p>
    <figure>
    <img src="QuarterlyElaborateCollardlizard.gif" height="200" width="400">
        <figcaption>Example of recaptures</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Meter</h2>
    <p id="width">There are two different meters you have in Killer Instinct. Your shadow meter which is used to activate your shadow specials and your Instinct meter which is used to enter instinct mode. Shadow meter is built by attacking the opponent. You can spend your shadow meter to use a shadow special when one of the two bars are filled up. Instinct meter is gained by being attacked by your opponent. You can activate instinct mode when the bar is full. Activating instinct mode puts your character into a state for a limited amount of time where they either have access to more special moves or their special moves attain new properties. </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="meter%20display.png" alt="Meter Display" width="600" height="350">
        <figcaption>The bar at the top left and right are your health bars. The bar located under the health bar is your instinct meter. The bars at the bottom right and bottom left are your shadow meters.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Combos</h2>
    <p id="width">Alright now that you've learned all the basics of the game lets go to the meat and potatoes of the game, COMBOS. Combos in Killer Instinct are different from combos in other fighting games. Combos in Killer Instinct have three parts. The opener, the linker and the ender. Think of combos in this game like a sandwich, the opener and ender are the pieces of bread and the linkers are the meat. You can't have a sandwich with just two pieces of bread and thats why you need linkers. Mixing up your linker strengths and varying your combos are very important which I will explain why below.</p>
    <figure>
    <img src="QuarrelsomeHappyBaboon.gif" height="200" width="400">
        <figcaption>Example of a combo and a reset</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Combo Breakers</h2>
    <p id="width">Combos are unique in Killer Instinct because they can be broken by the opponent if they press the two punch and kick buttons that match the strength of the move you just hit them with. For example if you hit the opponent with a heavy linker and they press heavy punch and heavy kick at the same time then they will break out of the combo. However combos that don't have a linker and if you were to go from an opener immediately into an ender then the opponent doesn't have to know what strength you used and can always break out of it by pressing the two heavy buttons together. That is why you need linkers in your combos to help prevent the opponent from breaking your combos.</p>
    <figure>
    <img src="SolidFocusedFly.gif" height="200" width="400">
        <figcaption>Example of a combo breaker</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="underline" class="center">Counter Breakers</h2>
    <p id="width">Counter breakers is something you do when you expect the opponent to attempt to break your combo at a certain point, you can perform a counter breaker by pressing the two medium buttons at the same time which will end your combo and put you in a vulnerable position but if you guessed right and they did attempt to break the combo then you are rewarded and get to continue your combo and they can't attempt to break out of the combo again for another three seconds. Counter breakers are where the mind games come into place because if you guess right then you are guarenteed to take at least 50% of their health but if you guess wrong you could also lose 50% of your life. Be careful when looking to counter break!</p>
